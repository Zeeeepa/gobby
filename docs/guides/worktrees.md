# Worktree Management Guide

Gobby uses git worktrees for parallel development, enabling multiple agents to work on different tasks simultaneously without conflicts.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create a worktree for a feature branch
gobby worktrees create feature/auth --task #123

# List worktrees
gobby worktrees list

# Show worktree details
gobby worktrees show WORKTREE_ID

# Sync with base branch
gobby worktrees sync WORKTREE_ID

# Clean up after merge
gobby worktrees delete WORKTREE_ID
```

```python
# MCP: Create a worktree
call_tool(server_name="gobby-worktrees", tool_name="create_worktree", arguments={
    "branch_name": "feature/auth",
    "task_id": "#123",
    "base_branch": "main"
})

# Claim worktree for an agent session
call_tool(server_name="gobby-worktrees", tool_name="claim_worktree", arguments={
    "worktree_id": "<worktree_id>",
    "session_id": "<agent_session_id>"
})
```

## Concepts

### What is a Git Worktree?

A git worktree is a linked working directory that shares the same repository:

```text
main-repo/              # Main working directory (main branch)
├── .git/
└── src/

.gobby/worktrees/
├── feature-auth/       # Worktree (feature/auth branch)
│   └── src/
└── bugfix-login/       # Worktree (bugfix/login branch)
    └── src/
```

All worktrees share:
- Git history
- Remote configuration
- Hooks

Each worktree has its own:
- Working directory
- Index (staging area)
- HEAD (current branch)

### Worktree Lifecycle

```text
created → claimed → active → released → merged → deleted
                      ↓
                   stale → cleaned up
```

- **created**: Worktree exists, no owner
- **claimed**: Agent has claimed ownership
- **active**: Agent is working in worktree
- **released**: Agent released ownership
- **merged**: Branch merged to base
- **deleted**: Worktree removed
- **stale**: No activity for extended period

### Task Linking

Worktrees can be linked to tasks:

```text
Task #123: Implement auth
└── Worktree: feature/auth
    └── Commits linked to task
```

This enables:
- Automatic branch naming
- Commit tracking
- Diff aggregation via `get_task_diff`

})

# Check status
call_tool(server_name="gobby-merge", tool_name="merge_status", arguments={})

## Clone Management

For complete isolation (separate remote tracking), use clones instead of worktrees.

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Create a clone
gobby clones create --branch feature/auth --task #123

# List clones
gobby clones list

# Spawn agent in clone
gobby clones spawn CLONE_ID "Implement feature"

# Sync with remote
gobby clones sync CLONE_ID

# Merge back
gobby clones merge CLONE_ID --target main

# Delete clone
gobby clones delete CLONE_ID
```

### MCP Tools

```python
# Create clone
call_tool(server_name="gobby-clones", tool_name="create_clone", arguments={
    "branch_name": "feature/auth",
    "task_id": "#123"
})

# List clones
call_tool(server_name="gobby-clones", tool_name="list_clones", arguments={
    "status": "active"
})

# Sync clone
call_tool(server_name="gobby-clones", tool_name="sync_clone", arguments={
    "clone_id": "<clone_id>"
})

# Merge to target
call_tool(server_name="gobby-clones", tool_name="merge_clone_to_target", arguments={
    "clone_id": "<clone_id>",
    "target_branch": "main"
})

# Delete clone
call_tool(server_name="gobby-clones", tool_name="delete_clone", arguments={
    "clone_id": "<clone_id>"
})
```

## Worktrees vs Clones

| Feature | Worktree | Clone |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Storage | Shared .git | Full copy |
| Speed | Fast create | Slower create |
| Isolation | Branch-level | Complete |
| Remote | Shared | Separate tracking |
| Use case | Parallel branches | Complete isolation |

**Use worktrees when:**
- Working on multiple branches in same repo
- Fast switching needed
- Shared git history is fine

**Use clones when:**
- Complete isolation required
- Separate remote tracking needed
- Testing against different repo states

## Agent Isolation Pattern

Spawn agents in worktrees for parallel development:

```python
# 1. Create worktree linked to task
worktree = call_tool("gobby-worktrees", "create_worktree", {
    "branch_name": "feature/task-123",
    "task_id": "#123"
})

# 2. Spawn agent with worktree isolation
call_tool("gobby-agents", "spawn_agent", {
    "prompt": "Implement the feature",
    "task_id": "#123",
    "session_id": "<parent_session>",
    "isolation": "worktree"
})

# Agent automatically works in the worktree
```

## Best Practices

### Do

- Link worktrees to tasks for traceability
- Sync regularly to avoid merge conflicts
- Clean up stale worktrees
- Use meaningful branch names

### Don't

- Create too many worktrees
- Leave worktrees unclaimed for long
- Delete worktrees with uncommitted changes
- Ignore stale worktree warnings

## Data Storage

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.gobby/worktrees/` | Worktree directories |
| `~/.gobby/gobby-hub.db` | Worktree metadata |
