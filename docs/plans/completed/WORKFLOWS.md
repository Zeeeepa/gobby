# Workflow Engine Plan

## Vision

Transform Gobby from a passive session tracker into an **enforcement layer** for deterministic AI agent workflows. Instead of relying on prompts to guide LLM behavior, workflows use hooks to enforce phases, tool restrictions, and transitions.

Key insight: **The LLM doesn't need to remember what phase it's in** - the workflow engine tracks state and hooks enforce it. The LLM sees tool blocks and injected context that guide it naturally.

Inspired by:

- [Parlant](https://github.com/emcie-co/parlant) - Behavioral enforcement over prompts
- [BMAD-METHOD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD) - YAML workflows with phases and agents

## Supported Patterns

### Plan-and-Execute

LLM plans steps first, then executes with validation loops for adjustments.

```text
plan → execute → validate ⟲ (loop on failure)
```

### ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)

Continuous reason-observe-act cycle with implicit validation via observation.

```text
reason → act → observe → reason (continuous cycle)
```

### Plan-Act-Reflect

Adds explicit critique/validate phase before replanning, common in coding agents.

```text
plan → act → reflect → replan (critique before continuing)
```

## Workflow Types

### Lifecycle Workflows

Event-driven workflows that respond to session events without enforcing phases or tool restrictions. They execute actions based on triggers.

**Use cases:**

- Session handoff (current behavior)
- Auto-save / backup
- Logging and analytics
- Notifications

**Characteristics:**

- `type: lifecycle`
- No `phases` section
- Only `triggers` section
- Actions execute in sequence per event
- Multiple lifecycle workflows can be active

### Phase-Based Workflows

State machine workflows that enforce phases with tool restrictions, transition conditions, and exit criteria.

**Use cases:**

- Plan-and-Execute
- ReAct
- Plan-Act-Reflect
- TDD

**Characteristics:**

- `type: phase` (default)
- Has `phases` section with allowed/blocked tools
- Has `transitions` and `exit_conditions`
- Only one phase-based workflow active at a time per session (can end one and start another)
- Multiple concurrent sessions can each run their own workflow
- Can coexist with lifecycle workflows

### File Locations

| Location | Purpose |
| ---------- | --------- |
| `~/.gobby/workflows/` | Global workflow definitions |
| `.gobby/workflows/` | Project-specific workflows |
| `~/.gobby/workflows/templates/` | Built-in templates (Plan-Execute, ReAct, etc.) |
| Session record | Workflow state (current phase, action count, etc.) |

### Workflow State

```python
@dataclass
class WorkflowState:
    workflow_name: str           # "plan-act-reflect"
    phase: str                   # Current phase: "plan", "act", "reflect"
    phase_entered_at: datetime   # When current phase started
    phase_action_count: int      # Actions taken in current phase
    total_action_count: int      # Total actions in session
    artifacts: dict[str, str]    # Named artifacts: {"current_plan": "...content..."}
    observations: list[dict]     # Observation buffer for ReAct pattern
    reflection_pending: bool     # Must reflect before continuing
    context_injected: bool       # Has handoff/summary been injected
    variables: dict[str, Any]    # User-defined workflow variables

    # Task decomposition state (for plan-to-tasks workflow)
    task_list: list[dict] | None      # Decomposed tasks with verification criteria
    current_task_index: int           # Index of current task being executed
    files_modified_this_task: int     # Track scope creep

    # NOTE: Workflow state is intentionally local-only.
    # Cross-session continuity is achieved by persisting work to the task system (tasks.jsonl),
    # not by syncing ephemeral workflow state.
```

## Hook Integration

### Hook → Workflow Mapping

| Hook Event | Workflow Actions |
| ------------ | ------------------ |
| `session_start` | Initialize state, restore handoff, enter initial phase |
| `prompt_submit` | Inject phase context, check pending reflection |
| `tool_call` | Validate tool allowed, evaluate rules, check transitions |
| `tool_result` | Capture observations, update action count, check error transitions |
| `assistant_response` | Check artifact creation, evaluate exit conditions |
| `session_end` | Save state, generate handoff |

### Hook Response Types

```python
class HookResponse:
    action: Literal["continue", "block", "modify"]
    message: str | None           # Shown to user on block
    inject_context: str | None    # Prepended to next prompt
    modify_request: dict | None   # Modifications to the request
```

### Evaluation Flow

```python
async def evaluate_workflow(event: HookEvent) -> HookResponse:
    # 1. Load workflow and state
    workflow = load_workflow(event.session_id)
    state = get_workflow_state(event.session_id)

    if not workflow:
        return HookResponse(action="continue")

    phase = workflow.get_phase(state.phase)

    # 2. Check tool permissions (for tool_call events)
    if event.type == "tool_call":
        if event.tool_name in phase.blocked_tools:
            return HookResponse(
                action="block",
                message=f"Tool '{event.tool_name}' not allowed in {state.phase} phase. "
                        f"Allowed: {phase.allowed_tools}"
            )

        # 3. Evaluate phase rules
        for rule in phase.rules:
            if evaluate_condition(rule.when, event, state):
                if rule.action == "block":
                    return HookResponse(action="block", message=rule.message)
                elif rule.action == "require_approval":
                    # Could prompt user or inject approval request
                    pass

    # 4. Check transitions
    for transition in phase.transitions:
        if evaluate_condition(transition.when, event, state):
            await enter_phase(state, transition.to, workflow)
            return HookResponse(
                action="modify",
                inject_context=f"[Transitioned to {transition.to} phase]"
            )

    # 5. Check exit conditions
    if all(check_condition(c, state) for c in phase.exit_conditions):
        next_phase = workflow.get_next_phase(state.phase)
        if next_phase:
            await enter_phase(state, next_phase.name, workflow)

    return HookResponse(action="continue")
```

## Built-in Templates

### 1. plan-execute.yaml

Basic planning enforcement. Plan phase restricts to read-only tools until user approves.

### 2. react.yaml

ReAct loop with observation capture. Each action's result is captured and injected into reasoning context.

### 3. plan-act-reflect.yaml

Full reflection workflow. Automatically enters reflection phase after N actions or on errors.

### 4. architect.yaml

BMAD-inspired development workflow. Phases: requirements → design → implementation → review.

### 5. test-driven.yaml

TDD workflow. Phases: write-test → implement → refactor. Blocks implementation until test exists.

### 6. plan-to-tasks.yaml

Task decomposition workflow. Takes a completed plan and breaks it into atomic, sequential tasks with verification criteria. Executes tasks one at a time with verification gates.

```yaml
name: plan-to-tasks
description: "Decompose a plan into atomic tasks and execute sequentially"
type: phase

variables:
  plan_pattern: "**/*.plan.md"
  max_tasks: 20
  require_task_approval: false

phases:
  - name: decompose
    description: "Break plan into atomic tasks"

    on_enter:
      - action: read_artifact
        pattern: "{{ plan_pattern }}"
        as: current_plan

      - action: call_llm
        prompt: |
          Break this plan into atomic, sequential tasks.
          Each task should be:
          - Single responsibility (one file, one function, one test)
          - Independently verifiable
          - Ordered by dependency

          Plan:
          {{ current_plan }}

          Output as JSON: {"tasks": [{"id": 1, "description": "...", "verification": "..."}]}
        output_as: task_list

      - action: persist_tasks
        source: task_list.tasks
        create_dependencies: sequential

        prompt: "Proceed with these {{ task_list.tasks | length }} tasks?"

  - name: execute
    description: "Work through tasks sequentially"

    on_enter:

        name: current_task_index
        value: 0

      - action: inject_message
        content: |
          Starting task {{ current_task_index + 1 }}/{{ task_list.tasks | length }}:
          {{ task_list.tasks[current_task_index].description }}

          Verification: {{ task_list.tasks[current_task_index].verification }}

    allowed_tools: all

    rules:
      # Prevent working on multiple tasks at once
      - when: "files_modified_this_task > 3"
        action: warn
        message: "Multiple files modified. Ensure you're focused on current task only."

    transitions:
      - to: verify
        when: "user_says('done') or user_says('next')"

  - name: verify
    description: "Verify current task completion"

    on_enter:

        content: |
          Verify task {{ current_task_index + 1 }} is complete:

          Task: {{ task_list.tasks[current_task_index].description }}
          Verification: {{ task_list.tasks[current_task_index].verification }}

          Run any tests or checks, then confirm.

    allowed_tools:
      - Read
      - Glob
      - Grep
      - Bash  # For running tests
      - TodoWrite

    blocked_tools:
      - Edit
      - Write

    transitions:
      - to: execute
        when: "verification_passed and current_task_index < task_list.tasks | length - 1"
        on_transition:
          - action: mark_todo_complete
            index: "{{ current_task_index }}"
          - action: increment_variable

          - action: inject_message
            content: "Task {{ current_task_index }} verified. Moving to task {{ current_task_index + 1 }}."

      - to: complete
        when: "verification_passed and current_task_index >= task_list.tasks | length - 1"

      - to: execute
        when: "verification_failed"
        on_transition:
          - action: inject_message
            content: "Verification failed. Returning to execute phase to fix issues."

  - name: complete
    description: "All tasks complete"

    on_enter:
      - action: mark_todo_complete
        index: "{{ current_task_index }}"

      - action: inject_message
        content: |
          All {{ task_list.tasks | length }} tasks completed!

          Summary:
          {% for task in task_list.tasks %}
          ✓ {{ task.description }}
          {% endfor %}
```

**Flow:**

```text
decompose → execute → verify ⟲ (loop until all tasks done) → complete
           ↑__________|
```

**Key features:**

- LLM-powered task decomposition with verification criteria
- TodoWrite integration for task tracking
- Verification gate between tasks
- Prevents scope creep with file modification warnings

### 7. session-handoff.yaml (Lifecycle Workflow)

Extracts the current session summary and handoff system as a workflow. This is a **lifecycle workflow** (no phases, just event responses) rather than a **phase-based workflow**.

```yaml
name: session-handoff
description: "Session summary generation and context handoff between sessions"
type: lifecycle  # No phases, responds to events

triggers:
  on_session_start:
    - action: find_parent_session
      when: "trigger_source == 'clear'"
      filter:
        status: handoff_ready
        same_project: true
        same_machine: true

    - action: restore_context
      source: parent_session_summary
      when: parent_session_found
      inject_as: system_context

    - action: mark_session_status
      target: parent
      status: expired
      when: context_restored

  on_session_end:
    - action: generate_summary
      generator: llm
      template: default  # or custom prompt

    - action: mark_session_status
      status: handoff_ready

  on_prompt_submit:
    - action: synthesize_title
      when: "session.title == null"
      generator: llm

    # Handle /clear as early handoff
    - action: generate_summary
      when: "prompt.strip().lower() == '/clear'"
      generator: llm
```

This demonstrates that:

1. **Lifecycle workflows** respond to events without enforcing phases
2. **Phase-based workflows** (plan-act-reflect, etc.) enforce tool restrictions and transitions
3. Both types can be active simultaneously on a session

---

## generate_handoff Action Specification

The `generate_handoff` action generates an LLM-powered session summary and stores it for the next session to consume.

### YAML Syntax

```yaml
- action: generate_handoff
  when: "event.data.get('prompt', '').strip().lower() in ['/clear', '/exit']"
  include:
    - artifacts
    - pending_tasks
  template: |
    Analyze this Claude Code session transcript and create a comprehensive summary.

    ## Transcript (last 50 turns):
    {transcript_summary}

    ## Last Messages:
    {last_messages}

    ## Git Status:
    {git_status}

    ## Files Changed:
    {file_changes}

    Create a markdown summary with sections:
    ## Overview
    ## Key Decisions
    ## Important Lessons Learned
    ## Next Steps
```

### Action Behavior

1. **Read `template:` kwarg** - LLM prompt for summary generation
2. **Get `transcript_path`** from `event.data`
3. **Parse transcript** - Extract last 50 turns (or since /clear)
4. **Gather context variables:**
   - `{transcript_summary}` - Formatted turns for LLM
   - `{last_messages}` - Last 2 user/agent message pairs
   - `{git_status}` - Output of `git status --short`
   - `{file_changes}` - Output of `git diff HEAD --name-status`
   - `{todowrite_list}` - Last TodoWrite tool call contents
   - `{session_tasks}` - Tasks linked to this session
5. **Call LLM** with rendered template
6. **Write summary** (see Storage Location below for strangler fig phases)
7. **Mark status** as `handoff_ready`

### ActionContext Requirements

The action requires additional services beyond the current ActionContext:

```python
@dataclass
class ActionContext:
    session_id: str
    state: WorkflowState
    db: LocalDatabase
    session_manager: LocalSessionManager
    template_engine: TemplateEngine
    # Required for generate_handoff:
    event: HookEvent | None = None              # For transcript_path
    transcript_processor: Any | None = None      # ClaudeTranscriptParser
    llm_service: Any | None = None               # LLMService for LLM calls
    config: Any | None = None                    # DaemonConfig for model settings
    session_task_manager: Any | None = None      # SessionTaskManager for tasks
```

### Storage Location (Strangler Fig Phases)

**Phase A (Validation):** Write to `workflow_handoffs.notes` column

- Both legacy SummaryGenerator and workflow action run in parallel
- Compare outputs to validate workflow produces equivalent results
- Legacy writes to `sessions.summary_markdown`, workflow writes to `workflow_handoffs.notes`

**Phase B (Migration):** Switch to `sessions.summary_markdown` column

- After validation passes, update action to write to production location
- Use `session_manager.update_summary(session_id, summary_markdown=content)`

**Phase C (Cleanup):** Remove legacy code and drop `workflow_handoffs` table

**Backup files:** `~/.gobby/session_summaries/` is a separate backup system, not managed by this action

## Context Injection

### Sources

| Source | Description |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `previous_session_summary` | LLM-generated summary from last session |
| `handoff` | Structured handoff data (phase, artifacts, pending tasks) |
| `artifacts` | Contents of captured artifacts (plans, specs) |
| `observations` | ReAct observation buffer |
| `workflow_state` | Current state as structured data |

### Injection Points

1. **on_enter**: When entering a phase
2. **on_prompt_submit**: Before each user prompt is processed
3. **on_transition**: When moving between phases

### Example Injection

```yaml
on_enter:
  - action: inject_context
    source: previous_session_summary
    template: |
      ## Previous Session Context
      {{ summary }}

      ## Handoff Notes
      {{ handoff.notes }}

      ## Pending Tasks
      {% for task in handoff.pending_tasks %}
      - {{ task }}
      {% endfor %}
```

---

## Storage Schema

### Workflow State Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_states (
    session_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    phase TEXT NOT NULL,
    phase_entered_at TIMESTAMP,
    phase_action_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    total_action_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    artifacts JSON,           -- ["plan.md", "spec.md"]
    observations JSON,        -- ReAct observation buffer
    reflection_pending BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    variables JSON,           -- User-defined variables
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(session_id)
);
```

### Handoff Table (DEPRECATED - Strangler Fig Migration)

> **Note:** The `workflow_handoffs` table is temporary scaffolding for the strangler fig migration pattern. After validation, `generate_handoff` will write directly to `sessions.summary_markdown` and this table will be dropped.

```sql
-- TEMPORARY: Will be removed after strangler fig validation
CREATE TABLE workflow_handoffs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    project_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    workflow_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    from_session_id TEXT,
    phase TEXT,
    artifacts JSON,
    pending_tasks JSON,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    consumed_at TIMESTAMP,      -- NULL until used
    consumed_by_session TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)
);
```

### Permanent Storage (Post-Migration)

Session handoff data is stored in the existing `sessions` table:

```sql
-- sessions table columns used for handoff:
summary_markdown TEXT,      -- LLM-generated session summary
summary_path TEXT,          -- Path to backup file (separate system)
status TEXT,                -- 'handoff_ready' when summary is generated
parent_session_id TEXT,     -- Links to previous session
```

File backups to `~/.gobby/session_summaries/` are handled by a **separate backup system**, not by workflow actions.

## MCP Tool Integration

### Workflow Tools for LLM

Expose workflow controls as MCP tools so the LLM can interact with workflows:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def list_workflows() -> dict:
    """List available workflow definitions (from project and global dirs)."""

@mcp.tool()
async def activate_workflow(name: str, initial_phase: str | None = None) -> dict:
    """
    Activate a phase-based workflow for the current session.

    Args:
        name: Workflow name (e.g., "plan-act-reflect", "tdd")
        initial_phase: Optional starting phase (defaults to first phase)

    Returns:
        Success status, workflow info, and current phase.

    Errors if:
        - Another phase-based workflow is currently active (must complete or end it first)
        - Workflow not found
        - Workflow is lifecycle type (those auto-run, not manually activated)
    """

@mcp.tool()
async def end_workflow(reason: str | None = None) -> dict:
    """
    End the currently active phase-based workflow.

    Allows starting a different workflow afterward.
    Does not affect lifecycle workflows (they continue running).
    """

@mcp.tool()
async def get_workflow_status() -> dict:
    """Get current workflow phase and state."""

@mcp.tool()
async def request_phase_transition(to_phase: str, reason: str) -> dict:
    """Request transition to a different phase. May require approval."""

@mcp.tool()
async def create_handoff(notes: str, pending_tasks: list[str]) -> dict:
    """Create a handoff for the next session."""

@mcp.tool()
async def mark_artifact_complete(artifact_type: str, file_path: str) -> dict:
    """Register an artifact as complete (plan, spec, etc.)."""
```

### Tool Filtering

When tools are restricted by phase, the MCP tool list should reflect this:

```python
async def list_tools(session_id: str) -> list[Tool]:
    all_tools = get_all_mcp_tools()
    workflow = get_workflow(session_id)

    if not workflow:
        return all_tools

    phase = workflow.current_phase

    if phase.allowed_tools == "all":
        blocked = set(phase.blocked_tools)
        return [t for t in all_tools if t.name not in blocked]
    else:
        allowed = set(phase.allowed_tools)
        return [t for t in all_tools if t.name in allowed]
```

## Decisions

| # | Question | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| 1 | **Workflow inheritance** | Yes - support `extends:` with property overrides | Standard pattern in YAML systems (Docker Compose, GitHub Actions). Reduces duplication. |
| 2 | **Multi-workflow support** | One phase-based workflow *active at a time per session*, unlimited lifecycle workflows | Phase-based workflows enforce tool restrictions; lifecycle workflows are event-driven observers. A phase workflow can complete (terminal phase or explicit end), allowing another to be activated. Multiple concurrent sessions can each have their own active workflow. |
| 3 | **Cross-session state** | Workflow state is session-local; persistence via task system | Ephemeral workflow state in SQLite for current session. Durable work tracked in tasks table for cross-session continuity. |
| 4 | **Approval UX** | Inject question via context, block tool until approval | Reuse existing patterns (similar to AskUserQuestion). No new UX paradigm needed. |
| 5 | **Escape hatches** | ✅ Resolved - `--force`, `reset`, `disable` CLI commands | See CLI Commands section. |
| 6 | **Workflow versioning** | Stop → Edit → Restart pattern | Mid-workflow changes ignored (YAML locked when activated). To apply changes: end workflow, edit YAML, activate again. |
| 7 | **Codex hook blocking** | N/A - only notify hook exists | Codex uses notify script only. Full hook control would require app-server session spawning. YAGNI for MVP. |
| 8 | **generate_handoff storage** | Write to `sessions.summary_markdown`, not `workflow_handoffs` | `workflow_handoffs` is temporary strangler fig scaffolding. The existing `sessions` table already has summary storage. File backups (`~/.gobby/session_summaries/`) are a separate system. |
| 9 | **Explainability** | SQLite audit log with CLI/MCP access | Inspired by Parlant's "Full Explainability". Enables debugging workflow decisions. Separate table for query flexibility. 7-day retention by default. |

---

## Explainability / Audit Trail

Inspired by [Parlant's](https://github.com/emcie-co/parlant) "Full Explainability" feature, Gobby provides an audit trail for workflow decisions. This enables developers to trace why specific rules fired and tools were blocked.

### Audit Log Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE workflow_audit_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    phase TEXT NOT NULL,
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'tool_call', 'rule_eval', 'transition', 'exit_check'
    tool_name TEXT,                  -- For tool_call events
    rule_id TEXT,                    -- Which rule was evaluated
    condition TEXT,                  -- The 'when' clause evaluated
    result TEXT NOT NULL,            -- 'allow', 'block', 'transition', 'skip'
    reason TEXT,                     -- Human-readable explanation
    context JSON,                    -- Additional context (tool args, state snapshot)
    FOREIGN KEY (session_id) REFERENCES sessions(session_id)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_session ON workflow_audit_log(session_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_timestamp ON workflow_audit_log(timestamp);
```

### Audit Entry Types

| Event Type   | When Logged               | Key Fields                                     |
| :----------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- |
| `tool_call`  | Tool permission check     | tool_name, result (allow/block), reason        |
| `rule_eval`  | Phase rule evaluation     | rule_id, condition, result, reason             |
| `transition` | Phase transition          | from_phase (in context), to_phase (in reason)  |
| `exit_check` | Exit condition evaluation | condition, result (met/unmet)                  |
| `approval`   | User approval gate        | result (approved/rejected/pending)             |

### Audit CLI Commands

```bash
# View audit log for current session
gobby workflows audit

# View audit log for specific session
gobby workflows audit --session <session_id>

# Filter by event type
gobby workflows audit --type tool_call

# Filter by result (show only blocks)
gobby workflows audit --result block

# Export as JSON
gobby workflows audit --format json > audit.json
```

### MCP Tool

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_workflow_audit(
    session_id: str | None = None,
    event_type: str | None = None,
    result: str | None = None,
    limit: int = 50
) -> dict:
    """
    Get workflow audit log entries.

    Args:
        session_id: Filter by session (default: current session)
        event_type: Filter by event type ('tool_call', 'rule_eval', etc.)
        result: Filter by result ('allow', 'block', 'transition')
        limit: Maximum entries to return

    Returns:
        List of audit entries with full context.
    """
```

### Example Audit Output

```bash
$ gobby workflows audit --result block

[2024-01-15 10:23:45] BLOCK tool_call
  Phase: plan
  Tool: Edit
  Reason: Tool 'Edit' not allowed in plan phase. Allowed: [Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch]

[2024-01-15 10:24:12] BLOCK rule_eval
  Phase: act
  Rule: require-read-before-edit
  Condition: tool == 'Edit' and file not in session.files_read
  Reason: Read the file before editing: src/server.py
```

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Visual workflow builder**: Generate YAML from a visual diagram
- **Workflow analytics**: Track phase durations, transition patterns, common blocks
- **Shared workflows**: Publish/import workflows from a registry
- **AI-assisted workflow creation**: "Create a workflow for TDD" → generates YAML
- **Conditional tool arguments**: Not just block tools, but restrict arguments (e.g., only allow `pytest` not `rm`)
