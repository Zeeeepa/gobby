You are reviewing code changes for the following task.

## Task
Title: {{ task_title }}

{{ criteria_section }}{{ priority_section }}{{ symbol_section }}

## Code Changes to Validate

```json
{
  "status": "valid" | "invalid",
  "summary": "Brief assessment of the changes",
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "acceptance_gap|test_failure|lint_error|type_error|security",
      "severity": "blocker|major|minor",
      "title": "Brief description",
      "location": "file:line (if applicable)",
      "details": "Full explanation",
      "suggested_fix": "How to resolve (if applicable)"
