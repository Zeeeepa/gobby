"""In-memory loop prompt dismissal tracker for doom loop detection.

Tracks how many times each agent run has had its loop detection prompt
auto-dismissed. When the count exceeds a threshold, the lifecycle monitor
should escalate (checkpoint + kill) instead of dismissing again.

Pure in-memory — no DB persistence needed because daemon restarts kill
all running agents anyway (orphaned tmux sessions are cleaned up by
check_unhealthy_agents).
