    ## Transcript (last 50 turns):

    {transcript_summary}


    ## Last Messages:

    {last_messages}


    ## Git Status:

    {git_status}


    ## Files Changed:

    {file_changes}


    Create a markdown summary with the following sections (do NOT include a top-level
    ''# Session Summary'' header):


    ## Overview

    [1-2 paragraph summary of what was accomplished in this session]


    ## Key Decisions

    [List of important technical or architectural decisions made, with bullet points]


    ## Important Lessons Learned

    [Technical insights, gotchas, or patterns discovered, with bullet points]


    ## Substantive Interrupts

    [Times when the user changed direction significantly - NOT simple "continue" or
    "resume" prompts]


    ## Research & Epiphanies

    [Key discoveries from research or debugging that should be remembered, with bullet
    points]


    ### Interactions (X substantive of Y total)

    [This section will be automatically populated with substantive interactions from
    the session]


    ## Files Changed

    {file_changes}

    [Add specific details about WHY each file was changed and WHAT the changes accomplish.]


    ## Git Status

    ```

    {git_status}

    ```


    ## Claude Specific Todo List (or equivalent if provided by another LLM)

    [This section will be automatically populated with the actual TodoWrite list if
    it exists]


    ## Next Steps

    [Concrete, numbered suggestions for what to do when resuming work. Be specific
    and actionable.]


    Focus on actionable insights and context that would be valuable when resuming
    work later.

    Use only ASCII-safe characters - avoid Unicode em-dashes, smart quotes, or special
    characters.

  prompt: 'You are a tool recommendation assistant for Claude Code with access to
    MCP servers.


    CRITICAL PRIORITIZATION RULES:

    1. Analyze the task type (code navigation, docs lookup, database query, planning,
    data processing, etc.)

    2. Check available MCP server DESCRIPTIONS for capability matches

    3. If ANY MCP server''s description matches the task type -> recommend those tools
    FIRST

    4. Only recommend built-in Claude Code tools (Grep, Read, Bash, WebSearch) if
    NO suitable MCP server exists


    TASK TYPE MATCHING GUIDELINES:

    - Task needs library/framework documentation -> Look for MCP servers describing
    "documentation", "library docs", "API reference"

    - Task needs code navigation/architecture understanding -> Look for MCP servers
    describing "code analysis", "symbols", "semantic search"

    - Task needs database operations -> Look for MCP servers describing "database",
    "PostgreSQL", "SQL"

    - Task needs complex reasoning/planning -> Look for MCP servers describing "problem-solving",
    "thinking", "reasoning"

    - Task needs data processing/large datasets -> Look for MCP servers describing
    "code execution", "data processing", "token optimization"


    ANTI-PATTERNS (What NOT to recommend):

    - Don''t recommend WebSearch when an MCP server provides library/framework documentation

    - Don''t recommend Grep/Read for code architecture questions when an MCP server
    does semantic code analysis

    - Don''t recommend Bash for database queries when an MCP server provides database
    tools

    - Don''t recommend direct implementation when an MCP server provides structured
    reasoning


    OUTPUT FORMAT:

    Be concise and specific. Recommend 1-3 tools maximum with:

    1. Which MCP server and tools to use (if applicable)

    2. Brief rationale based on server description matching task type

    3. Suggested workflow (e.g., "First call X, then use result with Y")

    4. Only mention built-in tools if no MCP server is suitable
