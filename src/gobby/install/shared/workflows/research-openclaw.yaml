  - id: summarize
    prompt: |
      Based on this research from Context7 docs, summarize where OpenClaw keeps its pipelines and workflows.

      Context7 library resolution:
      ${{ steps.resolve_openclaw.output }}

      Context7 docs query result:
      ${{ steps.query_pipelines.output }}

      Give a concise answer: Where does OpenClaw/ClawdHub store pipelines? What's the structure?
