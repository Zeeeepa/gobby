# /gobby-expand - Task Expansion Skill

Expand a task into atomic subtasks. YOU do the analysis and reasoning (visible in conversation).
Survives session compaction - spec is saved before execution.

## Input Formats

- `#N` - Task reference (e.g., `/gobby-expand #42`)
- `path.md` - Plan file (creates root task first, e.g., `/gobby-expand docs/plan.md`)

## Session Context

**IMPORTANT**: Use the `session_id` from your SessionStart hook context:
```
session_id: fd59c8fc-...
```

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Check for Resume

First, check if there's a pending expansion to resume:

```python
result = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "get_expansion_spec", {"task_id": "<ref>"})
if result.get("pending"):
    # Skip directly to Phase 4 with saved spec
    print(f"Resuming expansion with {result['subtask_count']} subtasks")
    # Jump to Phase 4
```

If `pending=True`, skip to **Phase 4** immediately.

### Phase 1: Prepare

1. **Parse input**: Task ref (`#N`) or file path (`plan.md`)

2. **If file path**: Read file content, create root task:
   ```python
   content = Read(file_path)
   # Extract first heading as title
   result = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "create_task", {
       "title": "<first_heading>",
       "description": content,
       "task_type": "epic",
       "session_id": "<session_id>"
   })
   task_id = result["task"]["id"]
   ```

3. **Get task details**:
   ```python
   task = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "get_task", {"task_id": "<ref>"})
   ```

4. **Check for existing children** and handle re-expansion:
   ```python
   children = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "list_tasks", {"parent_task_id": task_id})
   if children["tasks"]:
       # IMPORTANT: Re-expansion will delete all existing subtasks.
       # First, capture the full task object to preserve all fields.
       backup = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "get_task", {"task_id": task_id})

       # Prompt user for confirmation before cascade delete
       print(f"Task #{task_id} has {len(children['tasks'])} existing subtasks.")
       print("Re-expansion will delete all subtasks and their descendants.")
       # In practice, use AskUserQuestion tool for confirmation:
       # response = AskUserQuestion("Confirm re-expansion? This deletes all subtasks.", ...)
       # if not confirmed: return

       # Delete parent cascades to children
       call_tool("gobby-tasks", "delete_task", {"task_id": task_id, "cascade": True})

       # Re-create the parent task with ALL preserved fields from backup
       result = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "create_task", {
           "title": backup["title"],
           "description": backup["description"],
           "task_type": backup["type"],
           "priority": backup.get("priority"),
           "labels": backup.get("labels", []),
           "metadata": backup.get("metadata"),
           "validation_criteria": backup.get("validation_criteria"),
           "category": backup.get("category"),
           "session_id": "<session_id>"
       })
       task_id = result["task"]["id"]

       # Note: Commit links are tracked separately and cannot be preserved
       # through delete/create. If commits were linked, you may need to
       # re-link them manually using link_commit after re-creation.
   ```

### Phase 2: Analyze Codebase (VISIBLE)

Use YOUR tools to understand the codebase context. This analysis is visible in the conversation.

**Required analysis**:
- `Glob`: Find relevant source files matching the task domain
- `Grep`: Search for patterns, function names, classes
- `Read`: Examine key files for structure and patterns

**Required when plan references external libraries or GitHub repositories**:
- `context7`: Fetch library documentation for referenced packages/frameworks
- `gitingest`: Analyze referenced GitHub repositories for patterns and structure

Detection: Scan the task description/plan for:
- GitHub URLs (`github.com/...`, `github:...`)
- Library references (e.g., "SkillPort", "FastAPI", "React")
- Spec references (e.g., "Agent Skills spec", "OpenAPI spec")

If external references are found, you MUST use context7/gitingest before generating subtasks.

**Optional tools** (always available):
- `WebSearch`: External API/library research, current documentation

Example analysis approach:
```
1. Search for related code: Glob("**/auth*.py"), Glob("**/user*.py")
2. Find existing patterns: Grep("class.*Handler", type="py")
3. Read key files: Read("/src/api/routes.py")
4. If plan mentions "SkillPort": context7 to fetch SkillPort docs
5. If plan mentions "github.com/org/repo": gitingest to analyze repo structure
```

**What to extract from external research**:
- **Integrations**: How does the library connect? REST API, SDK, CLI, file format?
- **Dependencies**: What packages/tools are required? Version constraints?
- **Test patterns**: How does the reference project test this? Unit tests, integration tests, mocks?
- **Data models**: What are the key types/schemas/interfaces?
- **Error handling**: What errors can occur? How should they be handled?

### Phase 3: Generate & Save Spec

Think through the decomposition with these requirements:

**Requirements**:
1. **TDD Workflow in Descriptions**: Every `code` task description MUST include explicit TDD steps
2. **Atomicity**: Each task should be completable in 10-30 minutes
3. **Categories**: Use `code`, `config`, `docs`, `research`, `planning`, `manual`
4. **No separate test tasks**: TDD is embedded in each code task, not separate tasks
5. **Dependencies**: Use indices (0-based) to reference earlier subtasks

**Spec format**:
```python
spec = {
    "subtasks": [
        {
            "title": "Add User model with password hashing",
            "category": "code",
            "depends_on": [],
            "validation": "Tests pass. User model exists with hash_password method.",
            "description": "TDD: 1) Write tests for User model in tests/test_user.py covering creation and hash_password(). 2) Run tests (expect fail). 3) Implement User model in models/user.py. 4) Run tests (expect pass).",
            "priority": 2
        },
        {
            "title": "Implement login endpoint",
            "category": "code",
            "depends_on": [0],  # Depends on User model
            "validation": "Tests pass. POST /login returns JWT on valid credentials.",
            "description": "TDD: 1) Write tests for POST /login in tests/test_auth.py covering valid/invalid credentials. 2) Run tests (expect fail). 3) Implement login route in api/auth.py. 4) Run tests (expect pass)."
        },
        {
            "title": "Add logout endpoint",
            "category": "code",
            "depends_on": [1],  # Depends on login
            "validation": "Tests pass. POST /logout invalidates session.",
            "description": "TDD: 1) Write tests for POST /logout in tests/test_auth.py. 2) Run tests (expect fail). 3) Implement logout in api/auth.py. 4) Run tests (expect pass)."
        }
    ]
}
```

**Save the spec BEFORE creating tasks** (this enables resume):
```python
result = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "save_expansion_spec", {
    "task_id": "<ref>",
    "spec": spec
})
# Returns: {"saved": True, "task_id": "...", "subtask_count": N}
```

### Phase 4: Execute (ATOMIC)

Execute the saved spec atomically:
```python
result = call_tool("gobby-tasks", "execute_expansion", {
    "task_id": "<ref>",
    "session_id": "<session_id>"
})
# Returns: {"created": ["#43", "#44", "#45"], "count": 3}
```

This creates all subtasks and wires dependencies in one transaction.

### Phase 5: Report

Show the created task tree with refs and dependencies:

```
Created 3 subtasks for #42 "Implement user authentication":

#43 [code] Add User model with password hashing
    └─ validation: Tests pass. User model exists with hash_password method.

#44 [code] Implement login endpoint (depends on #43)
    └─ validation: Tests pass. POST /login returns JWT on valid credentials.

#45 [code] Add logout endpoint (depends on #44)
    └─ validation: Tests pass. POST /logout invalidates session.

Use `suggest_next_task` to get the first ready task.
```

## Subtask Categories

| Category | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| `code` | Implementation tasks (includes tests per TDD) |
| `config` | Configuration file changes |
| `docs` | Documentation updates |
| `research` | Investigation/exploration tasks |
| `planning` | Design/architecture tasks |
| `manual` | Manual testing/verification |

## TDD Approach

TDD workflow MUST be embedded in every `code` task description:

**Required description format for code tasks**:
```
TDD: 1) Write tests for <feature> in <test_file> covering <scenarios>.
     2) Run tests (expect fail).
     3) Implement <feature> in <source_file>.
     4) Run tests (expect pass).
```

**Why explicit TDD steps?**
- Agents skip tests when descriptions don't mention them
- "Tests pass" in validation is not enough - agents may write implementation first
- Explicit test file paths guide agents to correct locations
- "expect fail" / "expect pass" enforces red-green cycle

**Do NOT**:
- Create separate `[TEST]` and `[IMPL]` tasks
- Say only "write tests" without specifying what to test
- Omit test file paths from descriptions

## Error Handling

**Task not found**:
```
Error: Task #42 not found. Verify the task reference exists.
```

**Invalid spec**:
```
Error: Spec must contain 'subtasks' array with at least one subtask.
Each subtask requires a 'title' field.
```

**Session compaction recovery**:
If expansion was interrupted after Phase 3, the skill will detect the pending spec
and resume from Phase 4 automatically.
