# Contributing to Gobby

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Gobby! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- At least one supported AI CLI for testing:
  - [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)
  - [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
  - [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)

### Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GobbyAI/gobby.git
cd gobby

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the daemon in development mode
uv run gobby start --verbose

# Run tests to verify setup
uv run pytest
```

## Development Workflow

### Running the Daemon

```bash
# Start with verbose logging
uv run gobby start --verbose

# Check status
uv run gobby status

# Stop the daemon
uv run gobby stop
```

### Code Quality

We use automated tools to maintain code quality. Run these before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Linting
uv run ruff check src/

# Auto-format code
uv run ruff format src/

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=src/gobby --cov-report=html
```

### Code Style

- We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- Line length: 100 characters
- Target Python version: 3.13
- Type hints are required for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 conventions

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines
3. **Write tests** for new functionality
4. **Run the full test suite** to ensure nothing is broken
5. **Update documentation** if you're adding or changing features
6. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of changes

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single change
- Write clear commit messages
- Reference any related issues
- Ensure CI passes before requesting review

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run a specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_example.py -v

# Run tests excluding slow tests
uv run pytest -m "not slow"

# Run only integration tests
uv run pytest -m integration
```

### Test Coverage

We maintain a minimum of 80% test coverage. The CI will fail if coverage drops below this threshold.
