"""Tests for storing and reading parent_project_path in worktree project.json.

These tests verify that:
1. When a worktree is created, parent_project_path is stored in project.json
2. get_workflow_project_path() returns the parent path for worktrees
3. Edge cases when worktree is not inside a parent project
