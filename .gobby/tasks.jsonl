Agent and CLI Modules\n\n## Deliverable\n- [ ] Agent module path traversal validation function updated\n- [ ] Agent module turns tracking logic corrected\n- [ ] Agent module blocking wait mechanism fixed\n- [ ] CLI module argument parsing corrected for all flags\n- [ ] Windows compatibility fixes applied to file path handling\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Path Traversal Check\n- [ ] Path traversal validation rejects paths containing `../` sequences\n- [ ] Path traversal validation rejects paths containing `..\\\\` sequences (Windows)\n- [ ] Path traversal validation accepts absolute paths that don't traverse upward\n- [ ] Path traversal validation accepts relative paths without `../` or `..\\` sequences\n- [ ] Function returns boolean True for valid paths, False for invalid paths\n\n### Turns Tracking\n- [ ] Turn counter increments by 1 after each agent action\n- [ ] Turn counter initializes to 0 at agent creation\n- [ ] Turn counter persists across multiple consecutive agent calls\n- [ ] Turn counter resets to 0 when agent is reinitialized\n- [ ] Turn limit enforcement stops execution when counter exceeds configured max (default: 10 turns)\n\n### Blocking Waits\n- [ ] Blocking wait timeout defaults to 30 seconds\n- [ ] Blocking wait can be configured with custom timeout value in seconds\n- [ ] Blocking wait raises TimeoutError or equivalent when timeout is exceeded\n- [ ] Blocking wait returns immediately when condition is satisfied before timeout\n- [ ] Blocking wait checks condition at least every 0.1 seconds (polling interval)\n\n### Windows Compatibility\n- [ ] File paths use `os.path.join()` instead of hardcoded forward slashes\n- [ ] File paths use `pathlib.Path` for cross-platform compatibility where applicable\n- [ ] Line endings are handled with `os.linesep` or `\\n` normalization\n- [ ] Backslashes in Windows paths are escaped properly in string comparisons\n- [ ] Tests pass on both Windows and Unix-like systems for path operations\n\n### CLI Argument Mismatches\n- [ ] `--timeout` flag accepts integer values and passes to agent timeout parameter\n- [ ] `--max-turns` flag accepts integer values and passes to agent turn limit\n- [ ] `--verbose` flag defaults to False and sets logging level to DEBUG when True\n- [ ] `--input-path` flag accepts string values and validates against path traversal\n- [ ] `--output-path` flag accepts string values and creates parent directories if missing\n- [ ] All flags that expect values reject calls without values (e.g., `--timeout` without number fails)\n- [ ] Help text (`--help` or `-h`) displays all flags with correct argument types\n- [ ] Unknown flags trigger error message and exit code 1\n\n## Edge Cases / Error Handling\n\n### Path Traversal Edge Cases\n- [ ] Rejects path `../../sensitive/file.txt`\n- [ ] Rejects path `file.txt/../../other.txt`\n- [ ] Accepts path `current_dir/../same_level.txt` if base directory is validated\n- [ ] Handles empty string path (rejects or treats as current directory per spec)\n- [ ] Handles path with encoded traversal attempts like `%2e%2e/` (if URL-encoded inputs possible)\n\n### Turns Tracking Edge Cases\n- [ ] Correctly handles turn limit of 0 (no turns allowed, fails immediately)\n- [ ] Correctly handles turn limit of 1 (allows exactly one turn)\n- [ ] Correctly handles very large turn limits (1000+)\n- [ ] Properly logs warning at 80% of turn limit reached\n- [ ] Provides error message when max turns exceeded: \"Maximum turns (X) exceeded\"\n\n### Blocking Wait Edge Cases\n- [ ] Timeout of 0 seconds returns immediately with False if condition not met\n- [ ] Negative timeout values are rejected or treated as infinite\n- [ ] Timeout with condition satisfied immediately returns before full timeout\n- [ ] Multiple concurrent blocking waits don't interfere with each other\n- [ ] Timeout exception includes elapsed time in error message\n\n### Windows Compatibility Edge Cases\n- [ ] Handles UNC paths like `\\\\server\\share\\file.txt`\n- [ ] Handles mixed separators like `dir1/dir2\\dir3` (normalizes correctly)\n- [ ] Handles drive letters like `C:\\Users\\...` without issues\n- [ ] Symlinks on Windows don't bypass path validation\n- [ ] Case-insensitive path comparison works correctly on Windows (if applicable)\n\n### CLI Argument Edge Cases\n- [ ] `--timeout 0` sets timeout to 0 seconds (accepted)\n- [ ] `--timeout -5` rejects with error message \"Timeout must be non-negative\"\n- [ ] `--max-turns 0` sets turn limit to 0 (accepted)\n- [ ] `--max-turns abc` rejects with error message \"max-turns requires integer value\"\n- [ ] `--input-path` with path traversal attempt is rejected before execution\n- [ ] Multiple instances of same flag (e.g., `--timeout 10 --timeout 20`) uses last value or errors\n- [ ] Flag order doesn't matter: `--input-path X --timeout 30` works same as `--timeout 30 --input-path X`\n\n## Verification\n\n### Unit Tests\n- [ ] Agent module tests for path validation pass 100%\n- [ ] Agent module tests for turn tracking pass 100%\n- [ ] Agent module tests for blocking waits pass 100%\n- [ ] CLI module tests for argument parsing pass 100%\n- [ ] All path operations pass on Windows and Unix test environments\n\n### Integration Tests\n- [ ] End-to-end CLI test: `cli.py --input-path valid.txt --timeout 10 --max-turns 5` executes without errors\n- [ ] End-to-end CLI test: `cli.py --input-path ../../../etc/passwd` returns error code 1\n- [ ] Agent executes for exactly N turns when `--max-turns N` specified\n- [ ] Agent respects timeout and terminates within timeout + 1 second buffer\n\n### Code Inspection\n- [ ] No hardcoded `/` or `\\` separators in cross-platform file path code\n- [ ] No raw `../` checks; uses `os.path.normpath()` or `pathlib.Path.resolve()`\n- [ ] Turn counter variable exists and is accessible for testing\n- [ ] CLI argument parser defines all flags with correct types and defaults\n- [ ] CHANGELOG or commit message documents all 5 issue fixes", "override_reason": null}, "escalated_at": null, "escalation_reason": null}

Multiple critical requirements remain unimplemented:\n\n1. REGISTRY.PY - LIFECYCLE EVENTS: Only shutdown-phase events (agent_completed, agent_timeout) are emitted in cleanup_dead() and cleanup_stale(). MISSING: initialization and start-phase event emission. Requirement explicitly states events must be emitted at 'initialization, start, and shutdown phases' - only 1 of 3 phases addressed. Event payloads lack timestamp and structured logging format {timestamp}|{event_type}|{module}.\n\n2. SPAWN.PY - COMMAND INJECTION: While shlex.join() and subprocess.list2cmdline() add quoting, critical vulnerabilities persist: (a) GhosttySpawner's cmd_str passed to AppleScript without protection against newline/metacharacter injection; (b) ITermSpawner and TerminalAppSpawner escape_applescript() function only handles backslash and quote, NOT newlines (\\n) or other AppleScript control characters; (c) CmdSpawner's inner_cmd string not properly quoted - allows & | < > metacharacters to inject commands when passed to cmd /k; (d) NO environment variable key whitelist validation exists - only isidentifier() check which is insufficient for edge cases; (e) No validation that environment variable values don't contain command injection payloads.\n\n3. RUNNER.PY - TRACKING HANDLER: Changes only add comments and increment turns_made. COMPLETELY MISSING: (a) handler initialization with handler ID, process ID, and creation timestamp; (b) explicit state machine implementation (CREATED \u2192 ACTIVE \u2192 COMPLETED/ERROR); (c) handler logging for state transitions with timestamp and reason; (d) orphaned handler detection within 5 seconds of process termination; (e) handler cleanup with 300-second timeout; (f) process monitoring and health checks. The tracking_handler function is nested within run_agent() but has no independent lifecycle management.\n\n4. WORKTREES.PY - ATTRIBUTE ERRORS: Changes only modify output indentation in show_worktree(). COMPLETELY MISSING: (a) hasattr() checks before attribute access in worktrees module; (b) __init__() methods with explicit attribute initialization in Worktree classes; (c) .get() method for dictionary access instead of direct key access; (d) type hints for function parameters/return values; (e) None-returning error handling instead of AttributeError raising. The show_worktree() CLI function change is cosmetic and doesn't address the actual attribute error issues.\n\n5. STORAGE.WORKTREES.PY - SQL INJECTION: Field allowlist validation added in update() method (correct), but INCOMPLETE: (a) validation only in update() method - other methods (create, get, list) not reviewed for injection; (b) NO SQL keyword filtering in input validation (criteria requires rejecting SELECT, DROP, INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE in user inputs); (c) NO demonstration of parameterized statements in all queries; (d) NO testing for injection patterns like \"1' OR '1'='1\"; (e) No input sanitization for branch_name, worktree_path fields.\n\n6. TEST FIXES: Only two assertion fixes shown (test_constants.py and test_worktree_lifecycle.py). MISSING: (a) comprehensive mock object initialization verification; (b) fixture teardown improvements for temp files and database; (c) comprehensive test syntax validation across all files; (d) test coverage evidence; (e) all 14 issues require test validation but tests are not updated.\n\n7. EDGE CASES UNADDRESSED: (a) Command injection with special characters (;|&$()<>\\n) in spawn.py - only partially mitigated; (b) Lifecycle events emission when no handlers registered - not tested; (c) Tracking handler cleanup when process already terminated - not implemented; (d) Attribute access on garbage-collected objects - not handled; (e) SQL injection with OR clauses - not demonstrated as fixed; (f) Concurrent database writes deadlock - not addressed; (g) Handler cleanup exception handling - not implemented.\n\n8. VERIFICATION EVIDENCE ABSENT: No proof provided that: (a) pytest passes with exit code 0; (b) pylint has no critical/high issues; (c) bandit shows no confirmed security issues (B602, B603, B607, B608, B610, B611); (d) semgrep detects no injection patterns; (e) coverage shows no new uncovered lines; (f) manual review of all 14 specific issues. The diff shows changes to 16 files but only addresses ~2-3 issues substantively.\n\nSUMMARY: Approximately 25-35% of requirements addressed.

{"id": "gt-c11bd9", "title": "Task System V2: Commit Linking & Enhanced Validation", "description": "# Task System V2: Commit Linking & Enhanced Validation\n\n## Overview\n\nThis document outlines enhancements to gobby's task system focusing on two major areas:\n\n1. **Commit Linking** - Associate git commits with tasks for traceability and improved validation\n2. **Enhanced QA Validation** - Robust validation loop with recurring issue detection, escalation, and multi-agent support\n\nThese features address edge cases in the current validation system (e.g., validating already-committed work) and incorporate patterns from [Auto-Claude](https://github.com/AndyMik90/Auto-Claude) for production-grade QA loops.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Current Limitations\n\n1. **Validation only checks uncommitted changes** - If work was committed in a previous sprint, `get_git_diff()` returns nothing and validation fails\n2. **No traceability** - Can't see which commits implement which task\n3. **Simple pass/fail** - No detection of recurring issues or escalation path\n4. **Single-agent validation** - Same context validates its own work\n5. **Flat feedback** - Free-text feedback, not structured issues\n\n### Goals\n\n- Link commits to tasks for audit trail and validation context\n- Detect recurring validation failures and escalate appropriately\n- Support external validator agent for objectivity\n- Track full validation history per task\n- Run build/test checks before LLM validation\n\n## Data Model Changes\n\n### Tasks Table Additions\n\n```sql\n-- Add to tasks table\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN commits TEXT;              -- JSON array of commit SHAs\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN validation_history TEXT;   -- JSON array of validation attempts\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN escalated_at TEXT;         -- Timestamp when escalated to human\nALTER TABLE tasks ADD COLUMN escalation_reason TEXT;    -- Why it was escalated\n```\n\n### New Validation History Table\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE task_validation_history (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,\n    task_id TEXT NOT NULL,\n    iteration INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- 1, 2, 3...\n    status TEXT NOT NULL,                 -- valid, invalid, error, pending\n    feedback TEXT,                        -- LLM feedback text\n    issues TEXT,                          -- JSON array of structured issues\n    context_type TEXT,                    -- git_diff, commit_range, manual\n    context_summary TEXT,                 -- What was validated against\n    validator_type TEXT,                  -- internal, external_agent\n    created_at TEXT NOT NULL,\n    FOREIGN KEY (task_id) REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX idx_validation_history_task ON task_validation_history(task_id);\n```\n\n### Structured Issue Format\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"test_failure|lint_error|acceptance_gap|type_error|security\",\n  \"severity\": \"blocker|major|minor\",\n  \"title\": \"Brief description\",\n  \"location\": \"path/to/file:line\",\n  \"details\": \"Full explanation\",\n  \"suggested_fix\": \"How to resolve\",\n  \"recurring_count\": 0\n}\n```\n\n## Commit Linking\n\n### Concept\n\nTrack which git commits are associated with each task. This enables:\n\n1. **Validation against committed code** - Check `git diff <commits>` instead of just uncommitted changes\n2. **Traceability** - Audit trail of what was done for each task\n3. **Duplicate detection** - Know if work exists even after merge\n\n### MCP Tools\n\n```python\n@mcp.tool()\ndef link_commit(\n    task_id: str,\n    commit_sha: str,\n    auto_detected: bool = False,\n) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"\n    Link a git commit to a task.\n\n    Args:\n        task_id: Task to link to\n        commit_sha: Full or short SHA of the commit\n        auto_detected: Whether this was auto-linked (vs manual)\n\n    Returns:\n        Updated task with commits list\n    \"\"\"\n\n@mcp.tool()\ndef unlink_commit(task_id: str, commit_sha: str) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Remove a commit link from a task.\"\"\"\n\n@mcp.tool()\ndef auto_link_commits(\n    task_id: str,\n    since: str | None = None,  #

Get commits since session start\n    session = session_manager.get(session_id)\n    commits = get_commits_since(session.started_at)\n\n    for commit in commits:\n        # Parse task IDs from message\n        task_ids = extract_task_ids(commit.message)\n        for task_id in task_ids:\n            link_commit(task_id, commit.sha, auto_detected=True)\n```\n\n### Validation Integration\n\nUpdate `close_task` to use commit-based diff:\n\n```python\nasync def close_task(task_id: str, ...):\n    # ...existing code...\n\n    # Try commit-based diff first\n    if task.commits:\n        validation_context = get_task_diff(task_id)\n    elif not validation_context:\n        # Fall back to uncommitted changes\n        git_diff = get_git_diff()\n        if git_diff:\n            validation_context = f\"Git diff:\\n\\n{git_diff}\"\n```\n\n## Enhanced QA Validation Loop\n\nInspired by Auto-Claude's multi-agent QA system.\n\n### Configuration\n\n```yaml\n# config.yaml\ntask_validation:\n  enabled: true\n  provider: \"claude\"\n  model: \"claude-sonnet-4-20250514\"\n\n  #

file imports required modules: `pytest`, agent client, MCP proxy, tool registry, and workflow utilities\n- [ ] Test file is executable with `pytest tests/agents/test_tool_routing.py` command\n\n## Functional Requirements\n\n### Test Scenario 1: Internal Tool Routing\n- [ ] Test function `test_agent_calls_gobby_tasks_tool_routes_to_internal_registry` exists\n- [ ] Test creates an in-process agent with a simple task (e.g., \"call gobby-tasks tool\")\n- [ ] Test verifies tool call name matches `gobby-tasks` exactly\n- [ ] Test confirms tool execution does NOT call MCP client (no MCP proxy invocation)\n- [ ] Test confirms tool execution calls internal registry's `get_tool()` method\n- [ ] Test returns ToolResult with success status and tool output from registry\n- [ ] Test execution time is under 5 seconds\n\n### Test Scenario 2: External MCP Tool Routing\n- [ ] Test function `test_agent_calls_external_mcp_tool_routes_to_mcp_client` exists\n- [ ] Test creates an in-process agent requesting an external tool (e.g., \"call mcp://example/external-tool\")\n- [ ] Test verifies tool call name includes MCP namespace prefix\n- [ ] Test confirms tool execution calls MCP client via proxy (verifiable through mock/spy)\n- [ ] Test confirms tool execution does NOT call internal registry\n- [ ] Test returns ToolResult with response from MCP client\n- [ ] Test execution time is under 10 seconds (includes MCP roundtrip)\n\n### Test Scenario 3: Unknown Tool Error Handling\n- [ ] Test function `test_agent_calls_unknown_tool_returns_proper_error` exists\n- [ ] Test creates an in-process agent requesting a non-existent tool (e.g., \"call unknown-tool-xyz\")\n- [ ] Test confirms ToolResult is returned with error status (not exception thrown)\n- [ ] Test error message contains text \"tool not found\" or \"unknown tool\" (case-insensitive)\n- [ ] Test error message includes the requested tool name \"unknown-tool-xyz\"\n- [ ] Test confirms neither internal registry nor MCP client was called\n- [ ] Test execution completes without raising an exception\n\n### Test Scenario 4: Workflow Blocks Tool\n- [ ] Test function `test_workflow_blocks_tool_returns_blocked_error_without_calling_proxy` exists\n- [ ] Test creates a workflow with tool blocklist containing \"blocked-tool\"\n- [ ] Test creates an in-process agent within that workflow context\n- [ ] Test agent attempts to call \"blocked-tool\"\n- [ ] Test confirms ToolResult is returned with error status\n- [ ] Test error message contains text \"blocked\" or \"not allowed\" (case-insensitive)\n- [ ] Test confirms MCP proxy was NOT called for the blocked tool\n- [ ] Test confirms internal registry was NOT called for the blocked tool\n- [ ] Test execution completes without raising an exception\n\n### Test Scenario 5: Tool Execution Failure\n- [ ] Test function `test_tool_execution_failure_returns_tool_result_with_error_details` exists\n- [ ] Test creates an in-process agent calling a tool that raises an exception\n- [ ] Test confirms ToolResult is returned (not exception propagated to agent)\n- [ ] Test ToolResult error field contains the exception type name\n- [ ] Test ToolResult error field contains the exception message\n- [ ] Test ToolResult error field contains stack trace or line number information\n- [ ] Test confirms agent receives error status and can continue execution\n- [ ] Test execution completes without raising an unhandled exception\n\n## Edge Cases / Error Handling\n\n- [ ] Tool routing handles tools with special characters in name (e.g., \"tool-name-v2\")\n- [ ] Tool routing handles tools with namespace prefixes (e.g., \"mcp://server/tool\")\n- [ ] Tool routing handles concurrent tool calls from same agent (thread-safe)\n- [ ] Tool routing handles empty tool arguments gracefully\n- [ ] Tool routing handles null/undefined tool parameters without crashing\n- [ ] Blocked tool check is case-sensitive (e.g., \"Blocked-Tool\" \u2260 \"blocked-tool\")\n- [ ] MCP proxy connection failures result in ToolResult error (not agent crash)\n- [ ] Internal registry lookup failures result in ToolResult error (not agent crash)\n- [ ] Tool execution timeout (if applicable) returns ToolResult with timeout error\n\n## Verification\n\n- [ ] Run `pytest tests/agents/test_tool_routing.py -v` and all 5 test scenarios pass (5/5 passed)\n- [ ] Run `pytest tests/agents/test_tool_routing.py --cov=tests.agents` and coverage for tool routing code is \u226590%\n- [ ] Run `pytest tests/agents/test_tool_routing.py -x` (fail on first error) with no failures\n- [ ] All test functions have docstrings explaining the scenario being tested\n- [ ] No test function exceeds 150 lines of code (split into smaller tests if needed)\n- [ ] Test uses `pytest.mark.integration` decorator to identify as integration test\n- [ ] Test cleanup (mocks, fixtures) leaves no side effects for subsequent tests\n- [ ] All assertions include descriptive failure messages (e.g., `assert result.status == \"success\", f\"Expected success but got {result.status}\"`)", "override_reason": null},

The 'exec' command replaces the current shell process with the specified script, so when the script terminates, there's no parent shell left running.
