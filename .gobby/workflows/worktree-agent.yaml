  Restricted workflow for agents spawned in worktrees.

  This workflow limits tool access to prevent spawned agents from:
  - Creating new tasks (use existing tasks only)
  - Spawning additional agents (no nested spawning)
  - Creating new worktrees (stay in assigned worktree)

  Allowed operations:
  - Task management: get_task, update_task, close_task
  - Memory: remember, recall, forget
  - Standard development: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep

  Use case: Assigned to agents spawned via spawn_agent_in_worktree to
  enforce single-task focus and prevent orchestration recursion.

    Your assigned task is not yet complete. Please:
    1. Continue working on the task
    2. Commit your changes when ready
    3. Call close_task() to mark the task complete

    If you're stuck, check the task details with get_task().
