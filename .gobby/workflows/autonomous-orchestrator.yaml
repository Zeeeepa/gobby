name: autonomous-orchestrator

  Multi-agent orchestration workflow that spawns workers in worktrees,
  monitors progress, triggers reviews, and cleans up on completion.

  Key features:
  - Spawns agents in isolated worktrees for parallel work
  - Provider assignment by role (coding vs review)
  - Monitors concurrent agent progress
  - Routes completed work to review step
  - Cleans up merged worktrees
  - Loops until session_task tree is complete

  Usage:
    1. Create a parent task with subtasks (or expand an existing task)
    2. Activate this workflow with:
       - session_task: Parent task ID to complete
       - coding_provider: Provider for implementation (default: gemini)
       - review_provider: Provider for reviews (default: claude)
       - max_concurrent: Max parallel agents (default: 3)
    3. Workflow spawns workers, monitors, reviews, cleans up
    4. Exits when all subtasks are closed

version: "1.0"
type: step

# Session-scoped variables (set on activation or use defaults)

  session_task: null          # Parent task ID - required

  coding_model: null          # Optional model override for coding
  review_provider: "claude"   # Provider for code review
  review_model: "opus-4"      # Model for thorough reviews
  max_concurrent: 3           # Max parallel agents

    Orchestration incomplete. There are still running agents or uncompleted subtasks.

    Current state:

    Continue monitoring or wait for agents to complete.
