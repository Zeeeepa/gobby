  Meeseeks worker agent - spawns in worktree to complete a single task.
  "Hi, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!"

  Uses Gemini in an isolated git worktree. Designed to be spawned by
  a parent orchestrator (using auto-task-claude workflow).

  Key characteristics:
  - Runs in worktree isolation for clean git history
  - Uses Gemini as the AI provider
  - Follows work-task-gemini workflow (claim -> work -> close -> report -> shutdown)
  - Cannot spawn other agents (no recursion)
