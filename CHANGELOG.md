## [0.2.18]

### Breaking Changes

- **Database migration baseline raised to v107.** The minimum supported database version is now v107 (`_MIN_MIGRATION_VERSION = 107`). Databases created before v107 will raise `MigrationUnsupportedError` on startup. Recovery: backup `~/.gobby/gobby-hub.db`, delete it, and restart the daemon to recreate from the current baseline schema.

### Features

- **CRUD MCP tools for workflow/pipeline definitions** — `create_workflow`, `update_workflow`, `delete_workflow`, `export_workflow` tools with Pydantic validation, bundled-definition protection, and loader cache invalidation (#8402)
- **`get_pipeline` tool** with type filtering to retrieve pipeline details including steps, inputs, and outputs (#8404)
- **Pipeline CRUD wrappers** — `create_pipeline`, `update_pipeline`, `delete_pipeline`, `export_pipeline` with type-guarded routing so pipeline tools reject workflow definitions and vice versa (#8404)

### Bug Fixes

- Add type filtering to pipeline CRUD wrappers to prevent incorrect cross-type results (#8405)
- Fix chat UI issues — conversation titles, delete confirmation, `/clear` command, and config migration (#8406)
- Fix CLI workflow issues — variable commands, inspect output, manage commands, and test coverage gaps (#8407)
- Deduplicate memory entries in `.gobby/memories.jsonl` to reduce noisy recall (#8409)
- Add `httpx.RequestError` handler in workflow check command for consistent error reporting (#8409)
- Close DB connection in `_reset_state_manager_for_tests` before nulling globals (#8409)
- Standardize pipeline error returns to always include `success: false` flag (#8409)
- Narrow exception handling in workflow definition creation from broad `Exception` to `yaml.YAMLError` and `ValueError`/`TypeError` (#8409)
- Only include `session_id` in `deleteConversation` WebSocket payload when defined (#8409)

### Improvements

- Null-safe audit log rendering when `entry.result` is None
- Specific exception handlers in workflow CLI and pipeline modules
- Cache DB/state manager instances in workflow CLI helpers
- Pydantic v2 migration: `.dict()` → `.model_dump()` in workflow inspect
- Accept `.yml` extension for workflow imports
- Tighter daemon process detection in workflow reload
- Informative error message when daemon unreachable during reload
- Cache `value.lower()` in variable type parsing
- Wrap blocking DB calls with `asyncio.to_thread` in pipeline gatekeeper
- Preserve negative exit codes in pipeline exec steps
- Wrap blocking `spawn_agent` with `asyncio.to_thread` in pipeline handlers
- Expand sensitive variable filtering patterns in pipeline renderer
- Add `VoiceTranscriptionMessage` type with runtime validation in web chat

### Documentation

- Update workflow, pipeline, and Lobster migration guides to match current codebase (#8408)

### Tests

- Add 33-test suite for workflow/pipeline CRUD tools covering create, update, delete, export, type filtering, and error paths (#8402)

- Unified search abstraction with TF-IDF fallback
- Hybrid search combining TF-IDF and embeddings
- Semantic tool search via `search_tools`
- Automatic re-indexing on skill changes

### Breaking Changes

- __Default ports changed__ from 8765/8766 to 60887/60888 (GOBBY leetspeak)
- __Removed `no_commit_needed`__ escape hatch from `close_task` - commits are now required for tracked file changes
- __Legacy task expansion system removed__ - use skill-based expansion via `/gobby-expand`
- __Deprecated parameters removed__ from `SkillSearch`

### Improvements

- Progressive disclosure via MCP server instructions (`build_gobby_instructions()`)
- Standardized `HTTPException.detail` to dict format
- Auto-enrich MCP execution errors with tool schema
- Improved hook error message formatting for readability
- Block tools action to prevent Claude Code task ID collision
- Plan mode detection from UI-based activation
- Workflow shadowing visibility and error handling
- Priority display in active workflows
- Workflow activation prompt in meeseeks-box spawn instructions
- Agent spawning fixes (task_id resolution and terminal mode)
- Session ID injection into agent context
- Timestamps normalization in tasks.jsonl to RFC 3339 format
- Skill backup logic for existing installations
- CLI status output now shows Skills
- `/gobby` router skill and `/g` alias for quick access
- Top-level `alwaysApply` and `category` support in skill parser and storage
