## [0.2.6] - 2025-01-26

### Major Features

#### Skills System (Complete Overhaul)
- New `gobby-skills` MCP server with full CRUD operations (`list_skills`, `get_skill`, `search_skills`, `install_skill`, `remove_skill`, `update_skill`)
- `SkillLoader` supporting filesystem, GitHub repos, and ZIP archive imports
- `SkillManager` coordinator with change notification pattern
- `SkillSearch` with TF-IDF backend and hybrid search (TF-IDF + embeddings)
- `EmbeddingProvider` abstraction for semantic search
- Full CLI command group (`gobby skills list/show/install/remove/update/new/validate/doc`)
- YAML frontmatter parser for SKILL.md files per [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io)
- Skill directory structure support (scripts/, references/, assets/)
- Auto-sync bundled skills to database on daemon start
- Core skill injection into session-start hook
- Skill hints in hook error messages

#### Clone-Based Parallel Orchestration
- New `gobby-clones` MCP server for isolated parallel development
- `CloneGitManager` for git clone operations
- `spawn_agent_in_clone` tool for running agents in isolated clones
- `merge_clone_to_target` tool with conflict detection
- Clone storage layer with database migration
- Clone CLI commands (`gobby clones list/create/delete`)
- Updated `parallel-orchestrator` and `sequential-orchestrator` workflows

#### Conductor System (Autonomous Orchestration)
- `ConductorLoop` main daemon for autonomous task orchestration
- `TaskMonitor` for stale/blocked task detection
- `AgentWatcher` for stuck agent detection
- `AlertDispatcher` with logging and optional callme integration
- `ConductorConfig` for token budget management
- `SessionTokenTracker` with model column in sessions
- Conductor CLI commands (`gobby conductor start/stop/status`)
- Token metrics in `gobby-metrics` MCP server
- `TokenTracker` using LiteLLM pricing utilities

#### Inter-Agent Communication
- Inter-agent messaging MCP tools
- Blocking wait tools for task completion (`wait_for_task`, `wait_for_tasks`)
- `approve_and_cleanup` orchestration tool
- Handoff payload extended with `active_skills` field
- Session memory extraction workflow action

#### Task System Improvements
- Skill-based task expansion via `/gobby-expand` skill
- New expansion MCP tools replacing legacy `expand_task`
- `expansion_status` field in Task model
- `depends_on` parameter in `create_task`
- Dependency checking in `delete_task`
- Auto-claim task when creating with `session_id`
- Edit history tracking for task enforcement
- Configurable task lifecycle policies via workflow variables
- Lazy evaluation for `session_has_dirty_files` and `task_has_commits`

#### Unified Search
- Unified search abstraction with TF-IDF fallback
- Hybrid search combining TF-IDF and embeddings
- Semantic tool search via `search_tools`
- Automatic re-indexing on skill changes

### Breaking Changes

- **Default ports changed** from 8765/8766 to 60887/60888 (GOBBY leetspeak)
- **Removed `no_commit_needed`** escape hatch from `close_task` - commits are now required for tracked file changes
- **Legacy task expansion system removed** - use skill-based expansion via `/gobby-expand`
- **Deprecated parameters removed** from `SkillSearch`

### Improvements

- Progressive disclosure via MCP server instructions (`build_gobby_instructions()`)
- Standardized `HTTPException.detail` to dict format
- Auto-enrich MCP execution errors with tool schema
- Improved hook error message formatting for readability
- Block tools action to prevent Claude Code task ID collision
- Plan mode detection from UI-based activation
- Workflow shadowing visibility and error handling
- Priority display in active workflows
- Workflow activation prompt in meeseeks-box spawn instructions
- Agent spawning fixes (task_id resolution and terminal mode)
- Session ID injection into agent context
- Timestamps normalization in tasks.jsonl to RFC 3339 format
- Skill backup logic for existing installations
- CLI status output now shows Skills
- `/gobby` router skill and `/g` alias for quick access
- Top-level `alwaysApply` and `category` support in skill parser and storage
