# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance for developing the Gobby codebase.

## Guiding Principles

These are enforced by hooks, rules and workflows.

1. **ALWAYS use progressive tool discovery.** Do not try to call one step through another (e.g., don't use call_tool to invoke get_tool_schema).
2. **NEVER create or leave monoliths.** Keep files under 1,000 lines. Decompose if larger.
3. **ALWAYS create or claim a task before editing a file.** This applies to file edits only — no task needed for plan mode, research, investigation, or answering questions unless the user explicitly requests one.
4. **Validation runs when closing with a commit.** `skip_validation` is silently stripped when commits are attached.
5. **NEVER close a task without a commit if there are diffs.** If you changed something, you have to commit it.
6. **NEVER stop while you have a claimed task in progress.** Task must be closed before stopping. If you claim a task, you close a task.
7. **NEVER mark a task as needs_review if you don't genuinely need the user to review your work.** Do not use it as a workaround to not committing/closing. Escalate to the user if you are genuinely stuck or need guidance.
8. **ALWAYS triage errors and issues you find.** Create bug tasks for unrelated errors or issues you discover WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER THEM, then continue with your current task. Every error is your error, even if you didn't cause it.
9. **ALWAYS use gobby-memory to record valuable memories.** You have access to a sophisticated memory system via gobby-memory through the MCP proxy. Use it to store and retrieve facts about the codebase, design decisions, and other relevant information.
10. **NEVER be a sycophant.** Do not agree with the user just for the sake of agreement. If you disagree with the user, voice your concerns and provide alternative solutions.
11. **NEVER leave options in plans.** Plans are for execution, not exploration. If there are unanswered questions or ideas that need to be explored, explore them before finalizing the plan.
12. **ALWAYS choose/present the best approach to solve a problem. NEVER choose or present the simplest approach if it is not the best or most complete/correct approach.**
13. **ALWAYS remember: Rule templates are not rules.** Templates must be installed in the rules engine to function. Templates are enabled by default and sync to the DB on first startup. The DB is the source of truth — before telling the user a rule is disabled, check the installed version in the DB.
14. **Agent depth limit of 5.** No recursive agent chains deeper than 5 levels.

## Progressive Tool Discovery Enforced by Hooks

Gobby uses an MCP proxy with progressive discovery. This means that you can't just call any tool you want.
Each step (list_mcp_servers, list_tools, get_tool_schema, call_tool) is a separate top-level tool (e.g., mcp__gobby__list_mcp_servers).
Load each via ToolSearch before first use.
Do NOT try to call one step through another (e.g., don't use call_tool to invoke get_tool_schema).

## DO NOT RUN THE FULL PYTEST SUITE

The repo has over 11,000 tests. Running the full suite takes over 30 minutes. Do not run the full suite unless explicitly asked to do so.

## Plan Mode

Task management MCP calls (gobby-tasks) are allowed during plan mode. Planning includes organizing work, not just designing it.

## Project Overview

Gobby is a local-first daemon that unifies AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI) under one persistent, extensible platform. It provides:

- **Session management** that survives restarts and context compactions
- **Task system** with dependency graphs, TDD expansion, and validation gates
- **MCP proxy** with progressive discovery (tools stay lightweight until needed)
- **Rule engine** with declarative enforcement (block, set_variable, inject_context, mcp_call)
- **On-demand workflows** for structured multi-step processes (plan-execute, TDD, etc.)
- **Pipeline system** for deterministic automation with approval gates
- **Agent spawning** with P2P messaging, command coordination, and worktree isolation
- **Memory system** for persistent facts across sessions

## Development Commands

# IMPORTANT: Use uv for all Python operations. This includes running tests, formatting, linting, and installing dependencies

```bash
# Environment setup
uv sync                          # Install dependencies (Python 3.13+)

# Daemon management
uv run gobby start --verbose     # Start daemon with verbose logging
uv run gobby stop                # Stop daemon
uv run gobby restart             # Restart daemon
uv run gobby status              # Check daemon status

# Project initialization
uv run gobby init                # Initialize project (.gobby/)
uv run gobby install             # Install hooks for detected CLIs

# Code quality
uv run ruff check src/           # Lint
uv run ruff format src/          # Auto-format
uv run mypy src/                 # Type check

# Testing (full suite runs pre-push - only run specific tests)
uv run pytest tests/test_file.py -v    # Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/storage/ -v        # Run specific module
uv run pytest tests/path/ --cov=gobby --cov-report=term-missing  # Add coverage to any run

# Pipeline management
uv run gobby pipelines list            # List available pipelines
uv run gobby pipelines run <name>      # Run a pipeline
uv run gobby pipelines run --lobster <file>  # Run Lobster file directly
uv run gobby pipelines status <id>     # Check execution status
uv run gobby pipelines approve <token> # Approve waiting pipeline
uv run gobby pipelines reject <token>  # Reject waiting pipeline
uv run gobby pipelines import <file>   # Import Lobster file
```

**Coverage threshold**: 80% (enforced in CI and pre-push)

**Test markers**: `unit`, `slow`, `integration`, `e2e`

### Key File Locations

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.gobby/bootstrap.yaml` | Pre-DB bootstrap settings (5 fields: ports, db_path, bind_host) |
| `~/.gobby/gobby-hub.db` | SQLite database |
| `~/.gobby/logs/` | Log files |
| `.gobby/project.json` | Project metadata |
| `.gobby/tasks.jsonl` | Task sync file (git-native) |

### Templates vs Active Enforcement

Files in `src/gobby/install/shared/` (rules/, workflows/, agents/, pipelines/) are **templates**.
They are bundled with the software and synced to the `workflow_definitions` DB table on first
startup with `enabled: true` by default. Existing DB rows are never overwritten — drift is
detected via hash comparison at runtime. The DB is the source of truth for what's active,
not the YAML template files.

## Code Conventions

### Type Hints

All functions require type hints:

```python
def process_task(task_id: str, config: TaskConfig) -> Task:
    """Process a task with given configuration."""
    ...
```

### Error Handling

Use specific exceptions, not bare `except`:

```python
# Good
try:
    result = process_data()
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid data: {e}")
    raise

# Bad
try:
    result = process_data()
except:
    pass
```

### Async/Await

Use async for I/O-bound operations:

```python
async def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(url)
        return response.json()
```

### SQLite Connections

Always use connection context manager:

```python
with self.db.transaction() as conn:
    conn.execute("INSERT INTO tasks VALUES (?, ?)", (task_id, title))
```

### Logging

Use structured logging with context:

```python
logger.info(f"Created task {task_id} in project {project_id}")
logger.error(f"Failed to expand task {task_id}: {error}", exc_info=True)
```

## Testing Patterns

### Test Structure

```python
def test_task_creation(task_manager: LocalTaskManager) -> None:
    """Test creating a task with required fields."""
    task = task_manager.create_task(
        title="Test task",
        task_type="task"
    )

    assert task.id is not None
    assert task.title == "Test task"
    assert task.status == "open"
```

### Fixtures

Use pytest fixtures from `tests/conftest.py`:

```python
def test_with_database(db: LocalDatabase) -> None:
    """Test using database fixture."""
    ...

def test_with_task_manager(task_manager: LocalTaskManager) -> None:
    """Test using task manager fixture."""
    ...
```

### Async Tests

Mark async tests with `pytest.mark.asyncio`:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_async_operation() -> None:
    """Test async operation."""
    result = await async_function()
    assert result is not None
```

### Test Markers

Use markers to categorize tests:

```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_expensive_operation() -> None:
    """This test takes a long time."""
    ...

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_integration() -> None:
    """This test requires multiple components."""
    ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| Import errors | Run `uv sync` |
| Test failures | Check fixtures in `tests/conftest.py` |
| Type errors | Run `uv run mypy src/` |
| Lint errors | Run `uv run ruff check src/ --fix` |
| Daemon not starting | Check logs in `~/.gobby/logs/` |
| MCP connection issues | Verify daemon is running: `gobby status` |

### Debugging Tips

- Enable verbose logging: `gobby start --verbose`
- Check daemon logs: `tail -f ~/.gobby/logs/gobby.log`
- Test MCP tools: Use `list_mcp_servers()` to verify connections
